## Summary

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and determine if there is any bias 
toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.  Our analysis reveals 
that more than 20 total votes and the percentage of helpful votes is equal or great 
than 50.  This selection was made in order to pick reviews that are more likely to 
be helpful.   

**Positivity bias for reviews in the Vine Program**
In the analysis, we analyze 5-star review within conditions mentioned above.  
Calculations show that there is **no positivity bias for reveiws in the vine 
program.**  The results show that 5-star views from Vine members is 52.34% and the 
5-star reviews from non-Vine members was 52.69%.  The Non-vine reviews has a 
slightly higher percentage of the 5-star reviews, but not significant.  

**Additional analysis that could be performed**
We could expand this analysis by calculating percentage for all stars reviews.  
Based on the results in Figure 4 below, there is a larger difference in percentage for 1-star
reviews than for 5-star reviews.    Vine reviews have only 0.93% of 1-star reviews, while non-vine 
reviews have 13.35% 1-star reivews within conditions mentioned above.  similarly, there 
is a 1.87% 2-stars Vine reviews and 6.05% 2-star non-vine reviews.

Another idea for analyis could be to do a deeper dive to find out when and if reviews impact
sales as the product life cycle progresses.  On the Amazon Vine homepage, a description 
encourages "their most trusted reviews" on amazon to post opinions abuot the new and pre-release items
to aid in product launch and marketing.   It would be interesting to know if these reviews had a direct
impace or correlation as the sales are tracked over time.
